## Hi there 👋

My name is *Ewan*.

📚 I'm a student in France. I will do my second year of preparation classes for engineering exams.
🌻I'm currently learning how to code and how to be a good leader.
😁 My goal is to start my own company and to be able to travel the world while being a source of inspiration for other young people who have plenty of dreams in their head.

📫 You can contact me on Linkedin or ewan.vrj@gmail.com

_I wish you a wonderful day !_
